# Python Fundamentals Learning Project

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various fundamental concepts in Python programming.

## Files Overview

### Core Python Concepts
- **Fundamentals.py**: Basic Python concepts including variables, data types, type casting, print(), and input() functions
- **Operators.py**: Covers arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, membership, and identity operators
- **ControlFlow.py**: Demonstrates if-else conditions, for/while loops, break/continue statements
- **Functions.py**: Examples of function definitions, parameters, args/kwargs, lambda functions, map/filter/reduce

### Data Structures
- **DS.py**: Implementation and usage of:
  - Lists and list comprehension
  - Tuples
  - Dictionaries
  - Sets

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **oops.py**: OOP concepts including:
  - Classes and Objects
  - Inheritance
  - Method Overriding
  - Class vs Instance Variables

### Error Handling & File Operations
- **Exception.py**: Exception handling and string manipulation examples
- **FileHandling.py**: File operations including:
  - Reading and writing files
  - File pointers
  - Different file modes (read, write, append)

### Module Management
- **Modules**: Examples of:
  - Importing modules
  - Creating custom modules
  - Using popular libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)

### Sample Data
- **example.txt**: Text file used for file handling demonstrations

## Getting Started

1. Each Python file can be run independently
2. Files contain commented sections explaining different concepts
3. Code examples include practical demonstrations of concepts

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Required libraries for Modules examples:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib

## Usage

You can run any of the Python files directly:

```bash
python Fundamentals.py
python DS.py
python oops.py
# etc.
```

Each file contains self-contained examples with comments explaining the concepts.
